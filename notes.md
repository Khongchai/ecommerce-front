> > Just some small things, I think it would be good to provide more details about the piece, maybe by clicking on the album art, before having to add to cart
> > For example I wasn't able to recognize Massanet and John Williams by their picture only

> > "Please do have an account" could sound a bit strange. How about "If you don't have an account yet, please make one" ?
